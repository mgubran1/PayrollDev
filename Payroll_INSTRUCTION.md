- **PayrollHistoryEntry.java**: Data model for payroll history

### Current Features:
- ✅ Escrow panel exists and is functional
- ✅ Cash advance panel with comprehensive tracking
- ✅ Percentage configuration system
- ✅ Week locking functionality
- ✅ PDF export capabilities
- ❌ Missing: Visual "PAID" status display
- ❌ Missing: Escrow integration in summary calculations
- ❌ Missing: Progress indicators in summary table

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Add "PAID" Status Display

#### Location: PayrollSummaryTable.java

**Step 1.1**: Add a new "Status" column after the "NET PAY" column
- Create a new TableColumn for status display
- Use the locked weeks data to determine if a row is paid
- Style the cell with green color and bold font when status is "PAID"

**Step 1.2**: Modify the row factory
- Check if the current week is locked for each row
- Add visual styling to indicate locked/paid status

**Step 1.3**: Update the column configuration in `configureColumns()` method
- Add the status column to the table columns list
- Set appropriate width (100-120px)

### 2. Integrate Escrow in Summary Calculations

#### Location: PayrollTab.java

**Step 2.1**: Update the summary labels map
- Verify "escrowDeposits" is already in the summaryOrder array (it is at line 404)
- Ensure the label is being updated in `updateSummaryFromBackend()` method

**Step 2.2**: Verify PayrollCalculator integration
- Check that PayrollCalculator.PayrollRow includes escrowDeposits field
- Ensure the calculator is pulling escrow data from PayrollEscrow instance

**Step 2.3**: Update the net pay calculation
- Verify escrow deposits are being subtracted in the net pay calculation
- Check the formula in PayrollCalculator

### 3. Add Visual Progress Indicators

#### Location: PayrollSummaryTable.java

**Step 3.1**: Enhance the Escrow column (already exists at line 681)
- The progress bar is already implemented for escrow
- Verify it's working correctly with actual data

**Step 3.2**: Add progress indicators for advances
- In the advance repayments column, add a small progress indicator
- Calculate progress based on total advance vs. repaid amount

**Step 3.3**: Add tooltips
- Add informative tooltips showing detailed breakdowns
- Include target amounts and completion percentages

### 4. Update Week Lock Visual Feedback

#### Location: PayrollTab.java

**Step 4.1**: Modify `updateLockStatus()` method (line 1753)

- Show "PAID" in large green text when week is locked

**Step 4.2**: Update the summary section
- Add a status display box above or below the net pay display
- Use conditional rendering based on lock status

**Step 4.3**: Disable modification controls
- The code already disables tabs when locked (line 1774)
- Add visual indicators (opacity, strikethrough) to show disabled state

### 5. Enhance PDF Export

#### Location: PDFExporter.java

**Step 5.1**: Update the deductions section
- The escrow is already included in the deductions array (line 370)
- Verify it's displaying correctly

**Step 5.2**: Add visual enhancements
- Add color coding for different deduction types
- Include progress indicators in the PDF where applicable

**Step 5.3**: Add summary statistics
- Include week-over-week comparisons if available
- Add driver percentage information (already exists)

### 6. Update History Tracking

#### Location: PayrollHistoryEntry.java

**Step 6.1**: Verify all fields are captured
- The class already includes percentage tracking
- Ensure escrow and all deduction types are being saved

**Step 6.2**: Update PayrollHistoryDAO
- Ensure the save method captures all deduction types
- Verify the lock status is being persisted
